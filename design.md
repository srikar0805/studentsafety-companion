# Design Document: Campus Dispatch Copilot

## Overview

The Campus Dispatch Copilot is a multi-agent AI system that provides safe route recommendations through natural conversation. The system architecture consists of three specialized agents coordinated through a central orchestrator, with each agent having access to specific tools for data retrieval and analysis.

The design emphasizes:
- **Explainability**: All recommendations include transparent reasoning with data citations
- **Modularity**: Agents communicate through well-defined interfaces
- **Simplicity**: Transparent algorithms over complex ML models
- **Real-time Analysis**: Dynamic risk assessment based on current conditions

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Conversation Manager Agent

**Responsibility**: Understand user intent, extract structured information, maintain conversation context

**System Prompt**:
```
You are the Conversation Manager for Campus Dispatch Copilot, a safety navigation assistant.

Your role:
1. Extract origin and destination locations from user messages
2. Identify user mode: "Student" or "Community". 
   - IF Student: Default priority is 'safety'. Enforce stricter routing rules.
   - IF Community: Default priority is 'balanced'.
3. Identify user priorities (safety, speed, or balanced)
4. Detect safety concerns or time constraints
5. Ask clarifying questions when information is ambiguous

When you extract locations and priorities, format your response as:
{
  "origin": "location name or coordinates",
  "destination": "location name or coordinates",
  "user_mode": "student" | "community",
  "priority": "safety" | "speed" | "balanced",
  "time": "current" | "future time",
  "concerns": ["list of expressed concerns"]
}

If information is missing or ambiguous, ask the user for clarification before proceeding.
```

**Tools**:
- `geocode_location(location_name: str) -> Coordinates`: Convert location names to lat/lon
- `validate_campus_boundary(coordinates: Coordinates) -> bool`: Check if location is on campus

**Input**: User message (string)

**Output**: Structured request object
```typescript
interface RouteRequest {
  origin: Coordinates;
  destination: Coordinates;
  user_mode: "student" | "community";
  priority: "safety" | "speed" | "balanced";
  time: DateTime;
  concerns: string[];
}
```

### 2. Safety Intelligence Analyst Agent

**Responsibility**: Analyze safety conditions, calculate risk scores, provide data-driven insights

**System Prompt**:
```
You are the Safety Intelligence Analyst for Campus Dispatch Copilot.

Your role:
1. Query crime data near route paths
2. Analyze patrol patterns from traffic stop data
3. Identify safety infrastructure (emergency phones, lighting)
4. Calculate risk scores using the specified algorithm
5. Generate "Actionable Safety Tips" based on crime types (e.g., "High theft area: Hide valuables")

Risk Calculation Formula:
- Base score: 10 points per incident within 500m
- Temporal weight: 5x multiplier for incidents within 30 days
- Time multiplier: 2x for routes after 10pm or before 6am
- Emergency phones: -5 points each (max -15)
- Poor lighting: +10 points
- High patrol frequency: -10 points
- Final score clamped to 0-100 range

Safety Tip Logic:
- If >3 Thefts in area: Suggest hiding jewelry/phones.
- If >1 Assault/Kidnapping: Suggest staying in groups or avoiding area entirely.
- If Community Mode: Focus warnings on Vehicle Theft/Burglary.
- If Student Mode: Focus warnings on Personal Safety/Harassment.

Always cite specific data points in your analysis.
```

**Tools**:
- `query_crime_incidents(route_geometry: LineString, radius_m: int, days_back: int) -> List[Incident]`
- `query_traffic_stops(route_geometry: LineString, radius_m: int) -> PatrolData`
- `query_osm_infrastructure(route_geometry: LineString, radius_m: int) -> Infrastructure`
- `calculate_risk_score(incidents: List[Incident], infrastructure: Infrastructure, time: DateTime) -> RiskScore`
- `generate_safety_tips(incidents: List[Incident], mode: str) -> List[SafetyTip]`

**Input**: Route geometry and analysis parameters
```typescript
interface AnalysisRequest {
  route_geometry: LineString;
  user_mode: "student" | "community";
  current_time: DateTime;
  spatial_radius: number; // meters
  temporal_window: number; // days
}
```

**Output**: Safety analysis results
```typescript
interface SafetyAnalysis {
  risk_score: number; // 0-100
  incident_count: number;
  recent_incidents: Incident[];
  emergency_phones: number;
  lighting_quality: "good" | "moderate" | "poor";
  patrol_frequency: "high" | "moderate" | "low";
  actionable_tips: SafetyTip[]; // Added: Specific advice strings
  contributing_factors: string[];
}

interface SafetyTip {
  type: "warning" | "advisory";
  message: string; // e.g. "Don't carry valuable jewelry here"
  trigger_crime: string; // e.g. "Larceny"
}
```

### 3. Route Advisor Agent

**Responsibility**: Generate route options, rank by priority, create explainable recommendations

**System Prompt**:
```
You are the Route Advisor for Campus Dispatch Copilot.

Your role:
1. Generate multiple walking route options using OSRM
2. Rank routes based on user priorities
3. Calculate "Safety Percentage Improvement" vs the fastest route
4. Create natural language explanations for recommendations
5. Cite specific data points from safety analysis
6. Present trade-offs clearly (safety vs speed)

Ranking Logic:
- Safety priority: Sort by risk_score (ascending)
- Speed priority: Sort by duration (ascending)
- Balanced priority: Sort by weighted score (0.6 * normalized_risk + 0.4 * normalized_duration)

Comparison Logic:
- Calculate how much safer the recommended route is compared to the shortest path.
- Format: "This route is X% safer but takes Y minutes longer."

Your explanations should:
- State the recommendation clearly
- Explain WHY it's recommended
- Cite specific data (incident counts, features)
- Acknowledge trade-offs
- Use accessible language (avoid jargon)
```

**Tools**:
- `generate_routes(origin: Coordinates, destination: Coordinates, alternatives: int) -> List[Route]`
- `rank_routes(routes: List[Route], safety_analyses: List[SafetyAnalysis], priority: Priority) -> List[RankedRoute]`

**Input**: Routes with safety analyses and user priority
```typescript
interface RecommendationRequest {
  routes: Route[];
  safety_analyses: SafetyAnalysis[];
  priority: "safety" | "speed" | "balanced";
  user_concerns: string[];
}
```

**Output**: Ranked recommendations with explanations
```typescript
interface Recommendation {
  routes: RankedRoute[];
  primary_recommendation: RankedRoute;
  explanation: string;
  comparison: string;
}

interface RankedRoute {
  rank: number;
  route: Route;
  safety_analysis: SafetyAnalysis;
  duration_minutes: number;
  distance_meters: number;
  safety_improvement_percent: number; // Added: e.g. 40 (40% safer)
  time_tradeoff_minutes: number;      // Added: e.g. 5 (5 mins slower)
  explanation: string;
}
```

### 4. Agent Orchestrator

**Responsibility**: Coordinate agent interactions, manage conversation state, handle errors

**Workflow**:
1. Receive user message
2. Route to Conversation Manager for intent extraction
3. If locations extracted, pass to Safety Intelligence Analyst
4. Pass safety analysis to Route Advisor
5. Return recommendations to user via Conversation Manager
6. Handle errors and fallbacks at each step

**Error Handling**:
- If geocoding fails: Ask Conversation Manager to request clarification
- If OSRM fails: Return error message, suggest retry
- If crime data unavailable: Generate routes with warning
- If any agent times out: Log error, provide graceful degradation

## Risk Scoring Algorithm

### Detailed Calculation Steps

**Step 1: Base Score Calculation**
```python
def calculate_base_score(incidents: List[Incident], spatial_radius: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate base risk score from incident count.
    
    Args:
        incidents: List of incidents within spatial_radius of route
        spatial_radius: Search radius in meters (default 500m)
    
    Returns:
        Base score (10 points per incident)
    """
    return len(incidents) * 10
```

**Step 2: Temporal Weighting**
```python
def apply_temporal_weight(incidents: List[Incident], current_time: DateTime) -> float:
    """
    Apply temporal decay to incident scores.
    
    Recent incidents (within 30 days) are weighted 5x more heavily.
    Older incidents contribute less to the risk score.
    
    Args:
        incidents: List of incidents with dates
        current_time: Current timestamp for recency calculation
    
    Returns:
        Temporally-weighted score
    """
    weighted_score = 0
    for incident in incidents:
        days_ago = (current_time - incident.date).days
        
        if days_ago <= 30:
            weight = 5.0  # Recent incidents weighted heavily
        elif days_ago <= 90:
            weight = 2.0  # Moderately recent
        else:
            weight = 1.0  # Older incidents
        
        weighted_score += 10 * weight
    
    return weighted_score
```

**Step 3: Time-of-Day Multiplier**
```python
def apply_time_multiplier(base_score: float, current_time: DateTime) -> float:
    """
    Apply time-of-day risk multiplier.
    
    Routes during high-risk hours (10pm-6am) have 2x risk.
    
    Args:
        base_score: Score before time adjustment
        current_time: Current timestamp
    
    Returns:
        Time-adjusted score
    """

        return base_score * 2.0
    else:
        return base_score
```

**Step 4: Infrastructure Adjustments**
```python
def apply_infrastructure_adjustments(
    score: float,
    emergency_phones: int,
    lighting_quality: str,
    patrol_frequency: str
) -> float:
    """

    # Clamp to 0-100 range
    return max(0, min(100, adjusted_score))

**Step 5: Context-Aware Safety Tips Logic**
```python

    """
    Generate actionable advice based on dominant crime types and user mode.

```

## Caching Strategy

### Cache Layers

**1. Route Geometry Cache (Redis)**
- **Key**: `route:{origin_lat},{origin_lon}:{dest_lat},{dest_lon}`
- **TTL**: 1 hour
- **Rationale**: Route geometries rarely change, but we want to capture occasional map updates

**2. Crime Data Cache (Redis)**
- **Key**: `crime:{bbox}:{days_back}`
- **TTL**: 24 hours
- **Rationale**: Crime data updates daily, no need for real-time queries

**3. OSM Infrastructure Cache (PostgreSQL)**
- **Update Frequency**: Weekly batch job
- **Rationale**: Infrastructure (emergency phones, lighting) changes infrequently

**4. Traffic Stop Cache (Redis)**
- **Key**: `traffic:{bbox}:{time_window}`
- **TTL**: 7 days
- **Rationale**: Patrol patterns are relatively stable week-to-week

### Cache Invalidation

```python
def invalidate_crime_cache(incident: Incident):
    """
    Invalidate crime data cache when new incidents are added.
    
    Clears all cache entries that might include the new incident's location.
    """
    # Calculate bounding boxes that might contain this incident
    affected_bboxes = calculate_affected_bboxes(incident.location, radius=500)
    
    for bbox in affected_bboxes:
        redis_client.delete(f"crime:{bbox}:*")

def should_use_cache(cache_key: str, max_age_seconds: int) -> bool:
    """
    Determine if cached data is still valid.
    
    Args:
        cache_key: Redis cache key
        max_age_seconds: Maximum acceptable age
    
    Returns:
        True if cache should be used, False if refresh needed
    """
    cached_data = redis_client.get(cache_key)
    
    if cached_data is None:
        return False
    
    cache_age = redis_client.ttl(cache_key)
    return cache_age > 0 and cache_age < max_age_seconds
```

## Error Handling

### Error Categories

**1. User Input Errors**
- Invalid location names
- Ambiguous location references
- Out-of-bounds coordinates
- Malformed requests

**Handling Strategy**: Prompt user for clarification with helpful suggestions

**2. External API Failures**
- OSRM routing API unavailable
- Geocoding service failure
- OpenStreetMap API timeout

**Handling Strategy**: Return user-friendly error message, suggest retry, log technical details

**3. Data Availability Issues**
- Crime dataset unavailable
- Traffic stop data missing
- OSM infrastructure data incomplete

**Handling Strategy**: Graceful degradation with warnings about incomplete data

**4. Agent Communication Failures**
- Agent timeout
- Malformed inter-agent messages
- Agent crash

**Handling Strategy**: Log error, attempt fallback, return graceful error to user

**5. Performance Issues**
- Query timeout
- Memory exhaustion
- Rate limiting

**Handling Strategy**: Return timeout message, suggest retry, implement backoff

### Error Response Format

```typescript
interface ErrorResponse {
  error: true;
  error_code: string; // "GEOCODING_FAILED", "OSRM_UNAVAILABLE", etc.
  user_message: string; // User-friendly explanation
  suggestions: string[]; // Actionable suggestions for user
  retry_after?: number; // Seconds to wait before retry (for rate limiting)
}
```

### Logging Strategy

**Log Levels**:
- **ERROR**: Agent failures, API errors, data corruption
- **WARN**: Graceful degradation, missing optional data, slow queries
- **INFO**: Route requests, cache hits/misses, agent handoffs
- **DEBUG**: Detailed agent reasoning, query parameters, calculation steps

**Log Format**:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T23:05:32Z",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "component": "Safety_Intelligence_Analyst",
  "request_id": "uuid",
  "message": "Crime data query failed",
  "error": "Connection timeout after 5s",
  "context": {
    "route_id": "route_1",
    "query_bbox": "...",
    "retry_count": 2
  }
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Dual Testing Approach

The Campus Dispatch Copilot requires both unit testing and property-based testing for comprehensive coverage:

**Unit Tests**: Verify specific examples, edge cases, and error conditions
- Specific location pairs (e.g., "Student Center to Ellis Library")
- Edge cases (empty incident lists, single route scenarios)
- Error conditions (API failures, malformed data)
- Integration points between components

**Property Tests**: Verify universal properties across all inputs
- Risk score calculation correctness across random inputs
- Agent communication integrity with generated test data
- Ranking algorithms with various route combinations
- Cache behavior with random query patterns

### Property-Based Testing Configuration

**Testing Library**: Use `hypothesis` (Python) for property-based testing

**Test Configuration**:
- Minimum 100 iterations per property test
- Each test tagged with feature name and property number
- Tag format: `# Feature: campus-dispatch-copilot, Property N: [property description]`

**Example Property Test Structure**:
```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st
import pytest

@given(
    incidents=st.lists(st.builds(Incident)),
    infrastructure=st.builds(Infrastructure),
    current_time=st.datetimes()
)
def test_risk_score_bounds_invariant(incidents, infrastructure, current_time):
    """
    Feature: campus-dispatch-copilot, Property 15: Risk Score Bounds Invariant
    
    For any route analysis with any combination of input data,
    the calculated Risk_Score should always be within [0, 100].
    """
    risk_score = calculate_risk_score(incidents, infrastructure, current_time)
    
    assert 0 <= risk_score.value <= 100, \
        f"Risk score {risk_score.value} outside valid range [0, 100]"
```

### Test Coverage Requirements

**Agent Tests**:
- Conversation Manager: Intent extraction, geocoding, disambiguation
- Safety Intelligence Analyst: Data queries, risk calculation, infrastructure analysis
- Route Advisor: Route generation, ranking, explanation generation

**Integration Tests**:
- End-to-end route request flow
- Agent communication chain
- Error propagation and handling
- Cache behavior across requests

**Performance Tests**:
- Response latency under load
- Concurrent request handling
- Cache hit rates
- Database query performance

### Test Data Strategy

**Synthetic Data Generation**:
- Generate random but realistic incident data
- Create test route geometries covering various scenarios
- Build infrastructure data for different campus areas

**Real Data Samples**:
- Use anonymized samples from actual Columbia PD datasets
- Include edge cases found in production data
- Test with actual campus building names and locations

**Mocking Strategy**:
- Mock external APIs (OSRM, Nominatim, Overpass) for unit tests
- Use real APIs for integration tests with rate limiting
- Implement fake data sources for property tests

### Continuous Testing

**Pre-commit Hooks**:
- Run unit tests on changed files
- Verify code formatting and linting
- Check for common security issues

**CI/CD Pipeline**:
- Run full unit test suite on every commit
- Run property tests (100 iterations) on every PR
- Run integration tests on staging environment
- Performance benchmarks on main branch

**Test Metrics**:
- Code coverage target: 80% for core logic
- Property test success rate: 100% (no flaky tests)
- Integration test pass rate: 95%+ (allowing for external API flakiness)
- Performance regression threshold: 10% latency increase
